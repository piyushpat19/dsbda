To run this:

Step 1:
Save your Scala code that is in pdf file with a `.scala` extension, for example:
MyProgram.scala

Save it on the Desktop.

Step 2:
Then open inÂ terminal at desktop(as saved at desktop our code file)

Step 3:
Compile the Scala code using:
scalac MyProgram.scala

Note:
If successful, this will generate one or more `.class` files in the same directory.
If no `.class` files appear, check your code for errors.

Step 4:
Run the compiled Scala program using:
scala MyProgram

(make sure you leave off the `.scala` extension when running)
